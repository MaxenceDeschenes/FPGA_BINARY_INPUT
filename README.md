# FPGA_BINARY_INPUT
The FPGA Binary Input to Display System project involves designing and implementing a Verilog-based digital system on an FPGA. The system converts binary input into a 7-segment display output, optimizing logic synthesis for improved resource efficiency by 30%. Custom display control logic was developed and tested, achieving 99% system reliability.
